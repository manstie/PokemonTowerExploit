# PokemonTowerExploit
This script loads up the game in a window and injects some javascript code to change the css of the page which allows the game window to stretch. Stretching the game window introduces an exploit which can force both game participants to win. I have automated the exploit process.

# Controls
F5 = refresh page, in case it doesn't load properly, or the game gets stuck

F6 = toggle automatic explotation (uses mouse control, keep focus on window)

# Other
Made this in a day, my code probably sucks but it works
