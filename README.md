# Pokemon Tower Exploit
This script loads up the game in a window and injects some javascript code to change the css of the page which allows the game window to stretch. Stretching the game window introduces an exploit which can force both game participants to win. I have automated the exploit process by reading pixel data of the window and moving the mouse. I found the exploit myself on 2020/01/10. 

# Controls
 - F5 = refresh page, in case it doesn't load properly, or the game gets stuck
 - F6 = toggle automatic explotation (uses mouse control, keep focus on window)
 - Ctrl + Q = Stop GUI

# Requirements
pyHook (for python 3.7) can be found here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the rest

# Other
Made this in a day, my code probably sucks but it works
