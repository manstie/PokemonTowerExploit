# Pok√©mon Tower Battle Exploit
This script loads up the game in a window and injects some javascript code to change the css of the page which allows the game window to stretch. Stretching the game window introduces an exploit which can force both game participants to win. I have automated the exploit process by reading pixel data of the window and sending mouse inputs. I found the exploit on 2020/01/10. 

It appears that the devs of the game have found this and it will be a constant battle until they fix the exploit :P

# Controls
 - F5 = refresh page, in case it doesn't load properly, or the game gets stuck
 - F6 = toggle automatic explotation (uses mouse control, keep focus on window)
 - F7 = clean up html - removes facebook junk
 - F8 = print html to file "html.txt"
 - Ctrl + Q = Quit
 - Print Screen = output screenshot of window

# Requirements
~pyHook (for python 3.7) can be found here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook ~ No longer needed as pyautogui has been removed

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for all requirements

`pip install pyinstaller` if you want to build your own .exe

You can build it to an exe using `pyinstaller PokemonTowerExploit.spec`

# Other
If you are just looking for widescreen capabilites to manually exploit ~or have more vision on the edges of the platform,~ you can paste the [script](https://github.com/manstie/PokemonTowerExploit/blob/78772fb492fd82d34d4c728ef7f0b353d0b57911/PokemonTowerExploit.py#L252-L273) into [this page](https://www.facebook.com/instantgames/689199254876917/) in your browser's console, or manually change the css to your liking.
