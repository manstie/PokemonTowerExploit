# Pok√©mon Tower Battle Exploit
This script loads up the game in a window and injects some javascript code to change the css of the page which allows the game window to stretch. Stretching the game window introduces an exploit which can force both game participants to win. I have automated the exploit process by reading pixel data of the window and moving the mouse. I found the exploit on 2020/01/10. 

It appears that the devs of the game have found this and it will be a constant battle until they fix the exploit :P

# Controls
 - F5 = refresh page, in case it doesn't load properly, or the game gets stuck
 - F6 = toggle automatic explotation (uses mouse control, keep focus on window)
 - Ctrl + Q = Quit

# Requirements
pyHook (for python 3.7) can be found here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the rest

# Other
You can build it to an exe using `pyinstaller PokemonTowerExploit.spec` (`pip install pyinstaller` first)

If you are just looking for widescreen capabilites to either manually exploit or have more vision on the edges of the platform, you can paste the [script](https://github.com/manstie/PokemonTowerExploit/blob/1c101634a1e2cbbd472b6f7f6e1174f91a15e7a8/PokemonTowerExploit.py#L161-L179) into [this page](https://www.facebook.com/instantgames/689199254876917/) in your browser's console, or manually change the css to your liking.

Made this in a day, my code probably sucks but it works. After being left for a night:
